# Creating a Virtual Machine Using Azure


## Prerequisites and Installation

This tutorial outlines the prerequisites and installation steps for Creating a Virtual Machine Using Azure

## Environments and Technologies Used
 **Azure Portal**
- **The Azure Portal is the main web interface for creating, configuring, and managing Azure VMs and other resources** 
- **Usage: It offers a visual interface to select VM types, configure networking, assign storage, set up security, and manage monitoring options**


## Operating Systems Used
-  **Azure VMs can run Windows Server for enterprise and web hosting, various Linux distributions like Ubuntu, CentOS, and RHEL for open-source projects and development, while macOS can be used for connecting to and managing VMs using tools like Azure CLI and PowerShell** 

## List of Prerequisites

- **Azure Account** 
- **Computer with Internet Connection**
- **Credit Card (Required for free Azure credits)**

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Create an Azure Account 


1. Create an Azure account [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?icid=azurefreeaccount)
2. Follow the prompt to create the account
3. You will need to put in your credit card information for verification purposes, this will allow you to get $200 worth of Azure credit and will have 30 days to use those credits. You will not be charged until then
4. Finish the prompt, click Go to Azure Portal, and you are ready to start with Azure!

8. Next scroll down to size , we need to select a VM size with 2vcpus
9. Finally, we will create a username and password so we can login to our VM

### Step 5: Connect to the Virtual Machine (Windows)
1. First we need to find the public IP Address of our virtual machine
2. Select the virtual machine we created and copy the public IP Address on the right side of the Virtual Machine of the screen
